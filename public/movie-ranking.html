<h1>The Best Movies According to Victor</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is one the very few movies that actually made me cry.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings trilogy</h3>
<p>I know it's kinda cheating chosing three movies in one place, but it's my list, I make the rules.</p>
<h3>The Watchmen</h3>
<p>It's a rather long movie, but very worthy of the time spend on watching it.</p>
