<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>She's into superstitions<br/>
  Black cats and voodoo dolls<br/>
  I feel a premonition<br/>
  That girl's gonna make me fall</p>
  
  <p>She's into new sensations<br/>
  New kicks in the candlelight<br/>
  She's got a new addiction<br/>
  For every day and night</p>
  
  <p>She'll make you take your clothes off<br/>
  And go dancing in the rain<br/>
  She'll make you live the crazy life<br/>
  Or she'll take away your pain<br/>
  Like a bullet to your brain</p>

  <p>Upside, inside out<br/>
  She's living la vida loca<br/>
  She'll push and pull you down<br/>
  Livin' la vida loca<br/>
  Her lips are devil red<br/>
  And her skin's the color moca<br/>
  She will wear you out<br/>
  Livin' la vida loca<br/>
  Livin' la vida loca<br/>
  She's livin la vida loca</p>
